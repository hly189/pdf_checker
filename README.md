PDF CHECKER:

This program will search all the links which contain the .pdf files in the provided url and download all of them for you. 

In this version, the default mode is to download all the .pdf files which are found. In the near future, it will ask for the permission to see which file that you want to download. 

You should run "run.py" file to run the program and the defaul url that I used is "https://math.berkeley.edu/~jcalder/" 
You can use another one that you like 

P/S: I am in the process of fixing the bugs and updating the program. Therefore, it is probably not perfect.
