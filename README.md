PDF CHECKER:

This program will search all the links which contain the .pdf files in the provided url and download all of them for you. 

You should run "run.py" file to start the program

The defaul url that I used is "https://math.berkeley.edu/~jcalder/". You can use another one that you like 

VERSION 1.0: 
  the default mode is to download all the .pdf files which are found. 
  
VERSION 1.0.1: 

UPDATE 1: 

  Update options for run.py: 
  
    "-v": Show the current version of pdf_checker.
    
    "-a": allow you to download all the .pdf files which contain in the provided link.
    
    "-s": allow you to download selected .pdf file. It will ask to see which .pdf file that you want to.
    
    "--show": show all the .pdf files in provided link.

UPDATE 2:  
  check to see if the link has 403 and 404 error to download it. 

P/S: I am in the process of fixing the bugs and updating the program. Therefore, it is probably not perfect.
